  <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
  <p>
    Hip hop has undoubtedly evolved over the years, reflecting the changing times and cultural shifts. In this blog, we
    will explore the <em>key</em> differences and similarities between 90's hip hop and the hip hop of the 20's.

  <h2 style="color: rgb(79, 7, 7);"><u>The Sound</u></h2>
  <p>
    One of the most noticeable differences between 90's hip hop and 20's hip hop is <em>the sound.</em> In the 90's, hip hop was
    characterized by heavy beats, catchy hooks, and distinct samples from funk, soul, and R&amp;B music. Artists like
    <em>Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., Busta Rhymes, and Wu-Tang Clan</em> dominated the scene with their raw and gritty sound.

  <p>
    On the other hand, 20's hip hop has taken a more diverse approach to its sound. It incorporates elements from various
    genres, such as trap, EDM, and even rock. Artists like <em>Kendrick Lamar, Drake,</em> all the way down to <em>Playboi Cart and Lil Uzi Vert,</em> have experimented with
    different styles, resulting in a more eclectic and versatile sound in contemporary hip hop.

  <h2><u>Lyrics and Themes</u></h2>
  <p>
    Another significant difference between 90's hip hop and 20's hip hop lies in the lyrics and themes explored by the
    artists. In the 90's, hip hop was often characterized by socially conscious lyrics that addressed issues like
    racism, police brutality, and social inequality. Artists used their music as a platform for activism and bringing
    attention to the struggles faced by marginalized communities.

  <p>
    In the 20's, hip hop still addresses social issues, but the lyrical content has expanded to include a wider range of
    topics. Artists delve into personal experiences, relationships, mental health, and self-expression. The focus has
    shifted towards individuality, empowerment, and embracing one's uniqueness.

  <h2 style="color: rgb(79, 7, 7);"><u>Fashion and Visuals</u></h2>
  <p>
    When it comes to fashion and visuals, both eras of hip hop have made their mark. In the 90's, baggy clothes, oversized
    jackets, bucket hats, and gold chains were iconic fashion statements. Music videos showcased urban environments and
    street culture, often portraying a gritty aesthetic that reflected the artists' realities.

  <p>
    In the 20's, hip hop fashion has become more diverse and influenced by high fashion as well as the 90's fashion. Artists experiment with various
    styles, blending streetwear with designer brands. Now, you may see guys wearing long scarves over their heads, handbags, and satchels (a.k.a purses). However, they generally find ways to still make it look cool, and highly fashionable.  Visuals in music videos have also become more extravagant and
    cinematic, incorporating advanced special tech effects and artistic storytelling.

  <h2><u>The Impact</u></h2>
  <p>
    Both 90's hip hop and 20's hip hop have had a profound impact on music, culture, and society. The 90's era laid the
    foundation for many future artists, establishing hip hop as a mainstream genre, while the 20's continue to push the boundaries of hip hop to unimaginable heights.
    But beyond fashion, hip hop is now the modern day leaders of society. Whatever trends they set, fans of pop culture follow. It never gets boring watching their influence over the world!
